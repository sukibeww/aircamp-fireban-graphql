## Stack
* Javascript
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* GraphQL

## Challanges
---
#### Inconsistent structure and data

All of the above mentioned website have a different way of storing the information, some types of information is only provided by a particular website while other sources does not provide such information.

#### HTTP version ( ? )

I stumbled into a weird problem while trying to retrieve information from [Ruralfire](https://www.ruralfire.qld.gov.au/Pages/Home.aspx). I had to go through bunch of stackoverflow and github discussion regarding this problem. Turns out that it has something to do with node's http engine is not backward compatible. I had to containerize this project with docker in a Node v.10 image in order to enforce version of node that is compatible with this website.

## Justifications

#### Why MongoDB ? 

I started this project knowing that I have to go through a lot of weird and inconsistent data, with that in mind I knew that I have to use NoSQL database and I just happened to be familiar with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.

#### Why GraphQL ?

I started this project without knowing what kind of information that is deemed necessary and which are not, also as I mentioned before the provided information is inconsistent. I thought this is a good scenario for a GraphQL because it is super easy to modify the schema and query based on the actual use case down the road.
